The gameplay is similar to Tetris in which the player has to direct blocks of stone, mummy and/or treasure to create closures which eliminates the treasure and adds to the player's score. Also if a full line of stone blocks, treasure blocks or mummy blocks is formed they will disappear in a similar fashion to Tetris and also add to the player's score. <sup>[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Fortune){:target="_blank"}</sup>

Re-released on modern system as _Cleopatra Fortune S-Tribute_:

_Cleopatra Fortune_ was originally released as an arcade puzzle game by Taito in 1996. This game is a reproduction of the home console version released in 1997.

In Arcade Mode, players wipe out falling stones, treasures, coffins, and mummies by arranging closures or line clears to score high points. Two players can also play against each other.

In Mystery Mode, players can enjoy the story as they clear 50 problems posed by the Sphinx.<sup>[Publisher Description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1913690/Cleopatra_Fortune_STribute/){:target="blank"}</sup>
