The game is set in the Keiō era during the Edo Shogunate era of Japanese history (1865–1868). Rami Nanahikari, a seemingly typical teenager, has been the Guardian of the Key to the Secret Treasure, and is really a descendant of aliens who came to Earth in ancient times. She does not know the importance of the Treasure, and her overbearing grandmother does not remember what secret the Key unlocks. The Key has been stolen (while Rami was at the local convenience store), and now she must get the Key back.<sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_Flying_Squadron)</sup>
