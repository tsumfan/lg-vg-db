7th Dragon takes place in the high fantasy world of Eden. 80% of Eden is ruled by various fantasy reptiles, all led by 7 dragons, and their hostility to humans threatens society. The player takes the role of a huntsman who is tasked with eliminating the 7 dragons and saving humanity.

When players start their journey, they can create their own characters from the following classes: Mage, Princess, Rogue, Knight, Samurai, Fighter, or Healer. Outside of battle, the characters will be viewed traveling the overworld from an overhead perspective, while the battles are viewed from a side perspective showing each character as they attack their foes. <sup>[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Dragon){:target="_blank"}</sup>
