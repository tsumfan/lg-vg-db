Yo-kai Watch revolves around befriending Yo-kai that are haunting the city, which are based on traditional y≈çkai, but often with clever twists. If one befriends a Yo-kai, they get their Yo-kai Medal, an object that allows one to summon Yo-kai. With these, they can summon Yo-kai to either fight other Yo-kai, befriend others, or solve everyday tasks. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-kai_Watch)</sup>
