Community Pom is a 1997 action RPG/simulation game for the PlayStation, developed and published by Fill in Cafe (best known for the Asuka 120% and Kendo Rage/Makeruna! Makendou series). With gameplay reminiscent of classic 2D Zelda titles and perhaps most particularly influenced by Magic Knight Rayearth on the Sega Saturn, the game puts its own spin on things by throwing a simple pet raising simulation into the mix, with the player rearing Poms to increase their combat stats and unlock new features and abilities. <sup>[Source](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6301/){:target="_blank"}</sup>
