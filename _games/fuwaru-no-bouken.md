Minarai Mahou Tsukai Fuwaru no Bouken or "The Adventure of the Magical Apprentice Fuwaru-chan" is more commonly referred to as "Fuwaru the Apprentice". However, the game nowadays is quite hard to find, since MSD's (Marcken Software Developer) main website seems to be gone. Even when the game came out, there was very little buzz about it...just like another quality doujin game, Tirkiss ~Princess Shade~. The truth of the matter is; there are a number of "hidden gem" doujin games that don't get nearly enough mention and Fuwaru is no exception.<sup>[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0JKjgKXwMs)</sup>
