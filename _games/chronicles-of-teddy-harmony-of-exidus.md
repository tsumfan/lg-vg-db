Chronicles of Teddy is a side-scrolling action-adventure game in which the player controls a girl who is initially equipped with a weak sword. Although she can initially do little but run and jump, she will eventually be able to purchase various equipment and items that will upgrade her abilities. Many of these items can be bought in shops by spending marbles, which are the in-universe currency. As NPC dialogue is largely indecipherable until later in the game, the player must discover many aspects of the world, including game mechanics, menus, etc., through experimentation. <sup>[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Teddy:_Harmony_of_Exidus){:target: "_blank"}</sup>
