Set in a creepy and melancholic world, GYLT is an eerie story mixing fantasy and reality in a surrealist place where your nightmares become reality. Hide from terrible creatures or confront them as you find your way through the challenges of this wicked world.

Live the story of Sally, a little girl living in Bethelwood. Her life is not easy, and it has become even worse since her little cousin Emily disappeared. After being chased by a group of bullies, Sally is dragged into a twisted version of her town where her fears and worse memories are presented in a wicked and very real way.<sup>[Publisher Description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206210/GYLT/){:target="_blank"}</sup>
