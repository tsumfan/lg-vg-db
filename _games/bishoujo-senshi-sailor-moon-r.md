Following the second season of the anime series, which adapted the second arc of the manga, the players control one of the six Sailor Guardians and fight against enemies across several locations in order to protect Earth from both the Hell Tree aliens led by Ail and Ann as well as the Black Moon Clan led by Prince Demand, who are attempting to steal life energy from humans and the Star Points of future Crystal Tokyo. Like its predecessor, the game was met with mixed reception from critics since its release. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bish%C5%8Djo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_R_(1993_video_game))</sup>
