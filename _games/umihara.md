Umihara Kawase is a girl who uses a fishing hook as a grappling hook. You’ll need quick reflexes to swing your way through the branching surreal environments. Use your brains to figure out the best way through. They say fish is brain food—you’re going to need it! <sup>[Publisher Description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/378750/Sayonara_Umihara_Kawase/)</sup>
