Magical Pop'n is a side-scrolling action-platform game similar to The Adventure of Little Ralph. The player takes control of the Princess, the main protagonist of the game, through six stages of varying themes set in the land of To'ahl. The main objective is to recover the kingdom's powerful Magic Jewel that was stolen by the army of the game's main antagonist, the Demon King, and defeat his many servants. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Pop%27n)</sup>
