 In the depths of a labyrinthine ruin, a young girl named Mion rises from a deep sleep. Lost, alone, and with no memory of how she got here or where her parents are, she is greeted by two firefliesâ€”one composed entirely of light, and another who lurks among the shadows. <sup>[Publisher Description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368640/htoLNiQ_The_Firefly_Diary/){:target="_blank"}</sup>
