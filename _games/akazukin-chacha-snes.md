Akazukin Chacha is an RPG based on the anime of the same name. The battles are few and seem to be directly related to story events, so in that case it almost plays more like an interactive story than what most people would think of as an RPG. You play as ChaCha, Shiine-chan and Riiya. <sup>[Source](https://www.romhacking.net/games/250/){:target="_blank"}</sup>
