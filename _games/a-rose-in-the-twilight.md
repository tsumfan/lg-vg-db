A Rose in the Twilight (ロゼと黄昏の古城, Rose to Tasogare no Kojō, lit. "Rose and the Old Castle of Twilight") is a puzzle-platform game with horror elements. It was created by Japanese game developer Nippon Ichi Software for the PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows. The game is directed and designed by Masayuki Furuya. The game's art style consists exclusively of white, black, grey, and red. 

Rose finds herself in an ancient castle filled with thorns and vines, along with a mysterious rose that emits the color red. With the help of a giant creature, Rose embarks on a journey to discover why she was given the rose and uncover the secrets behind the castle. Seemingly immortal, Rose must face difficult challenges such as gruesome sacrifices needed to open new areas of the castle.
