Little Magic is a Super Famicom puzzle game published by Altron. The protagonist, May, needs to take one more final test at her magic academy before graduating as a fully-fledged witch. This exam takes the shape of a series of block-pushing tests, where the trainee witch needs to use her magic to maneuver the block to where it needs to be. <sup>[Giantbomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/little-magic/3030-2263/)</sup>
