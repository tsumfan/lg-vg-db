"Magical Drop III" is a puzzle game released in 1997 by Data East. With adjustments and additions to the system from Magical Drop II, this version is much more lively and chain-based than its predecessor. Along with the addition of the Magical Journey mode, there are now more ways to enjoy the action. <sup>[Publisher Description](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/aca-neogeo-magical-drop-iii-switch/)</sup>
