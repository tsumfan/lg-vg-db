Stretch Panic, known as Freak Out in Europe and Oceania and Hippa Linda (ひっぱリンダ, Hippa Rinda) in Japan, is an action-platform video game designed by Treasure Co. Ltd. It was a landmark title for the developer as it was their first game to feature movement on a 3D plane; prior to Stretch Panic they had been a developer of 2D titles. The game revolves around a girl named Linda who has the power to pinch, stretch, and bend objects and enemies with a magic scarf as she battles her evil sisters. The game was released on July 27, 2001 in Europe, August 28, 2001 in North America and December 6, 2001 in Japan. <sup>[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch_Panic){:target="_blank"}</sup>
