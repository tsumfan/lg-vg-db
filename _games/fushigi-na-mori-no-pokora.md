In Fushigina Morino Pokora you play as a little girl who is trying to catch cute creatures called Pokora which are stealing acorns. Featuring some adorable visuals and innovative controls this game quickly breaks from the mold placed by other games. Your goal in this game is to catch as many Pokora as you can within the given time limit. To help you in this endeavor you have a radar shows you the location of these furry creatures. Considering you have a limited amount of time you wonâ€™t be able to take your time and plan an attack, instead you will be charging head on toward the evasive Pokora. <sup>[Online Review](https://ricedigital.co.uk/doujin-classics-fushigina-morino-pokora/)</sup>
