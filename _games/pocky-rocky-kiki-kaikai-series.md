Kiki Kaikai is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Taito for arcades in 1986. Set in Feudal Japan, the player assumes the role of a Shinto shrine maiden who must use her o-fuda scrolls and gohei wand to defeat renegade spirits and monsters from Japanese mythology. The game is noteworthy for using a traditional fantasy setting in a genre otherwise filled with science fiction motifs. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_Kaikai)</sup>
