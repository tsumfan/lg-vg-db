Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 allows the player to form a team of monsters to train and use in combat. Depending on which version of the game players buy, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Cobi's Journey or Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventure, they control either Cobi or Tara, but the titles are nearly identical in gameplay and story. Both games, however, possess unique collections of monsters and magic keys. Instead of the original games focus on randomized dungeons, this title focuses on static ones with tasks to complete, though randomized dungeons are still available for exploration. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters_2)</sup>
