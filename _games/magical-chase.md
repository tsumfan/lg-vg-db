Magical Chase is a horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to Cotton and Gradius. The game stars a young witch named Ripple, an apprentice who broke a promise she made to her witch teacher by taking a peek inside a forbidden book and freeing six demons. Unless she can catch all six and get them back inside the book, the witch will turn Ripple into a frog. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Chase)</sup>
