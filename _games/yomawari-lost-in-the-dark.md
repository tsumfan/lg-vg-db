A young girl awakens in a dark, unfamiliar forest with no recollection of how she got there. As she searches for the way out, she crosses paths with a mysterious individual who reveals to her that sheâ€™s been cursed. In order to break the curse, she needs to explore the streets of her town at night to seek out her lost memories. However, malevolent ghosts lurk within the shadows, and the girl must avoid them by running, hiding, and shutting her eyes if she hopes to survive long enough to break her curse. <sup>[Publisher Description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998330/Yomawari_Lost_in_the_Dark/){:target="_blank"}</sup>
