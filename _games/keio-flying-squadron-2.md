The second installment of the series continues the story of Rami Nana-Hikari's adventures as the keeper of the Secret Treasure. A year has passed since the apocalyptic disaster which left a great crater in the center of Edo City. The destruction wrought major economic consequences and while much investment was poured into the public works for the new Edo Castle, the citizens were all feeling the pinch of the recession. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_Flying_Squadron_2)</sup>
