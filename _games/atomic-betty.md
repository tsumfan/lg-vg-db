Betty has a lot more to handle than most little girls. To her friends and family, she is your average, girl-next-door, but when the galaxy beckons, she becomes Atomic Betty, Galactic Guardian and Defender of the Cosmos. With the help of her trusty sidekicks, Sparky and X-5, Betty must save the galaxy from the evil Maximus I.Q., while at the same time saving her reputation on Earth from the scheming of her archrival, Penelope. &quot;Atomic Betty's&quot; five playable characters, rocket ship travel, selectable gadgets and weapons, and fast-paced story bring the cartoon hit to life. <sup>[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/atomic-betty/)</sup>
