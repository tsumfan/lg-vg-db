Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island is a role-playing video game developed by Japanese developer Amazing for the Nintendo DS.

The game was released in Japan on March 12, 2009 and in North America on October 27, 2009. It is the first to be released in North America to have the gameplay and structure of the "main" Atelier series, having less emphasis on RPG elements and more focus on item creation and resource management. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_Annie:_Alchemists_of_Sera_Island)</sup>
