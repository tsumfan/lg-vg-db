The player controls a witch named Momopie, who must clean 33 floors of a castle. Each floor, arranged in a maze-like fashion, is made up of smaller tiles covered in dirt, in which Momopie must use her giant paintbrush to clean them with. <sup>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter_Momopie)</sup>
