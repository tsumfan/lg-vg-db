Towelket: One More Time is a Japanese series of free indie RPG games made on RPG Maker 2000 by Kanao, first released in 2008. It features cute graphics mixed with a strange, fantasy and sci-fi atmosphere akin to Earthbound; although with occasional disturbing content and dirty jokes, giving it a charming unevenness. Most of the main games involve aliens invading the world and attempting to harm humans, with the main party being tasked with surviving the destruction. <sup>[Description Credit](https://towelket.fandom.com/wiki/Towelket_:_One_more_time_Wiki)</sup>
