<p>Rose finds herself in an ancient castle filled with thorns and vines, along with a mysterious rose that emits the color red.

Seemingly immortal, Rose must face difficult challenges such as gruesome sacrifices needed to open new areas of the castle. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rose_in_the_Twilight" target="_blank">Source:Wikipedia</a></p>
