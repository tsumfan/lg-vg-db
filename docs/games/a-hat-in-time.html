        <p>A Hat in Time is a platform game developed by Danish game studio Gears for Breakfast and published by Humble Bundle. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 3 and funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which doubled its fundraising goals within its first two days. The game was self-published for macOS and Windows in October 2017, and by Humble Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles two months later. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released in October 2019.</p>

<p>The game centers around Hat Kid, an alien girl trying to get back to her home by recovering lost “Time Pieces”, an in-game collectible. The gameplay consists of running through an open world environment by platforming, dodging obstacles, and obtaining collectibles. It is inspired by earlier 3D platformers such as Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon and Psychonauts. It has been favorably compared to classic platformers and has been considered an indie success after the long decline of platforming games. There also have been several DLC expansions with different modes and custom levels as well as online multiplayer. The PC version of the game allows the use of mods through the Steam Workshop. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hat_in_Time" target="_blank">Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
